This PowerShell script is designed to generate an HTML report for virtual machine (VM) backups. It integrates with vCenter and Veeam Backup & Replication servers, collects backup data, and formats it into a report. Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1. Permissions Setup:
The script is set up with Read-Only permissions for vCenter and Backup Viewer permissions for Veeam. These permissions allow the script to access necessary data without making changes to the environment.

2. Loading Required Modules:
Veeam PowerShell Snap-in: The script loads the Veeam PowerShell snap-in for interacting with Veeam Backup & Replication.
PowerCLI Configuration: Configures VMware PowerCLI to ignore SSL certificate errors for connections to vCenter.

3. Credential Management:
Hardcoded credentials are used for both vCenter and Veeam Backup servers. The credentials are stored securely using PowerShell's ConvertTo-SecureString function and converted to a PSCredential object.

4. Connection to Servers:
The script connects to the vCenter server (which manages VMware ESXi hosts and VMs) using the provided credentials.
It also connects to the Veeam Backup server, where backup jobs and restore points are stored.

5. Collecting VM Data from vCenter:
It retrieves all VMs from the vCenter server using the Get-VM command.

6. Filtering Veeam Backups:
It filters Veeam backups based on job names that start with "All" ($_JobName -like "All*"). This can be customized to focus on specific backup jobs.
For each VM, the script attempts to find the corresponding backup restore points.

7. Looping Through VMs:
For each VM, it:
Retrieves the VM name from vCenter.
Searches for matching restore points from the Veeam backup.
Counts the number of restore points for the VM.
Retrieves the last backup date and all restore point dates, formatted in Australian date/time style (DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:ss).
If no restore points are found, the script marks the VM's backup as "Never".

8. Disconnecting from Servers:
Once all data is gathered, the script disconnects from both the vCenter and Veeam Backup servers.

9. Generating HTML Report:
The script creates a styled HTML report containing the VM names, last backup dates, and restore points.
CSS: The style section defines the appearance of the table, including alternating row colors and a hover effect for rows.
JavaScript: Provides a search/filter function for the HTML table, allowing users to filter VM names or backup details as they type.
The restore points are shown as a collapsible dropdown list, allowing users to view all restore points for each VM.

10. Saving the Report:
The final HTML content is saved to a file (C:\VMBackupReport.html), which can be opened in a web browser.
The script outputs a notification indicating the location of the generated report.

11. Final Cleanup:
The script disconnects from the Veeam Backup & Replication Server once the report is generated.
Overall Purpose:
This script is designed to automate the process of generating a backup status report for virtual machines, by retrieving data from both vCenter and Veeam Backup & Replication, and displaying the results in a clear, interactive HTML format. The report helps track the status of VM backups and allows users to quickly check the availability of restore points for each VM.
